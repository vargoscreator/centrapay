However, in addition to the collection based on consent, there are other bases on which we may collect or process your personal data for the following purposes:</li>

                        <li>Legal Basis for Processing</li>
                        </ol>



                        <p>&nbsp; We comply with the legal provisions of the Federal Act on Data Protection (FADP), the Ordinance to the Federal Act on Data Protection (DPO) and other data protection provisions insofar as they apply to data processing carried out by us, such as the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).<br>This Privacy Policy and all matters arising out of or relating to it shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the substantial laws of Switzerland, excluding its conflict of law provisions. All disputes arising out of or in connection with this Privacy Policy shall be submitted to the competent courts of the Canton of Zug, Switzerland.<br>&nbsp; We process your personal data based on the following legal grounds:</p>



                        <p>Consent: When you provide consent for specific purposes (e.g., receiving marketing communications).<br>Contractual Necessity: To fulfil our contractual obligations and provide you with our services.<br>Legal Obligation: To comply with legal and regulatory requirements (e.g., anti-money laundering laws).<br>Legitimate Interests: To improve our services, enhance security, and protect our business interests.<br>&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>-Data retention<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this privacy policy, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.<br>We implement appropriate organizational, technical and administrative measures to protect the personal data covered by this statement from unauthorized access, destruction, loss, alteration or misuse.&nbsp; Unfortunately, no data transmission or storage system is entirely secure.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; We may continue to retain your personal information to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations, to enable fraud monitoring, detection, and loss prevention activities, and to comply with our tax, accounting, and financial reporting obligations. This includes where such retention is required by our contractual arrangements with our financial partners (and where your payment methods require data retention).<br>If we retain your personal information, we will do so by any statute of limitations and record-keeping obligations imposed by applicable law.<br>No purpose in this notice will require us to keep your personal information for longer than the period users have an account with us.<br>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it. Suppose this is impossible (for example, because your personal data has been stored in backup archives).

These measures include:</p>



                        <p>Encryption and Regular Audits:</p>



                        <ol>
                        <li>Our users trust &nbsp; with their sensitive data and rely on us to be good custodians of their customer’s data. As a payments infrastructure company, our security posture continually evolves to meet the rigorous standards of the global financial industry.<br>&nbsp;uses best-in-class security practices to maintain a high level of security.<br>PCI DSS certified. A PCI-certified auditor evaluated&nbsp; &nbsp; and certified us to PCI Service Provider Level 1. This is the most stringent level of certification available in the payments industry. This audit includes both &nbsp; &nbsp; Card Data Vault (CDV) and the secure software development of our integration code.<br>We provide our users with features to automate some aspects of PCI compliance.<br>The CTO is responsible for reviewing the current document at least once every 12 months to ensure its relevance to &nbsp; business and risk environment and compliance with PCI DSS.</li>



                        <li>The security of your data is important to us. When you visit our website, we use the widespread SSL (Secure Socket Layer) procedure in conjunction with the highest level of encryption supported by your browser. As a rule, this is 256-bit encryption. If your browser does not support 256-bit encryption, we use 128-bit v3 technology instead. You can tell whether an individual page of our website is encrypted by the closed display of the key or lock symbol in the lower status bar of your browser.<br>&nbsp; For secure connections, we mandate using HTTPS and HSTS for all services using TLS (SSL), including our public website and the dashboard. We regularly audit the details of our implementation, including the certificates we serve, the certificate authorities we use, and the cyphers we support. We use HSTS to ensure browsers interact with SmartCore only over HTTPS. &nbsp; is also on the HSTS preloaded lists for all modern major browsers.<br>All server-to-sever communication is encrypted using mutual transport layer security (mTLS), and &nbsp; has dedicated PGP keys for users to encrypt communications with&nbsp; &nbsp; or verify signed messages they receive from&nbsp; . Our systems automatically block requests made using older, less secure versions of TLS, requiring at least TLS 1.2.</li>
                        </ol>



                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The SmartCore.pro domain, including the Dashboard and API subdomains, is on the top domains list for Chrome, providing extra protection against homoglyph attacks. This makes it harder to create fake pages that look like https://SmartCore.swiss in Chrome.</p>



                        <p>Monitoring and protecting information from leaks:</p>



                        <p>We proactively scan the internet for our merchants’ API keys. If we find a compromised key, we take appropriate action, advising the user to roll their API key. We use the GitHub Token Scanner to alert us when a user’s API keys have been leaked on GitHub. If we find external phishing pages that might catch our users, we work proactively with our vendors to take those down and report them to Google Safe Browsing.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Our security teams regularly test our infrastructure, scanning for vulnerabilities, conducting penetration tests, and conducting red team exercises. We hire industry-leading security companies to perform third-party scans of our systems and immediately address their findings. Our servers are frequently and automatically replaced to maintain their health and discard stale connections or resources. Server operating systems are upgraded well in advance of their security end-of-life (EOL) date.<br>&nbsp; We have several dedicated security teams specialising in different security areas, including infrastructure, operations, privacy, users, and applications. Security experts are available 24/7 through on-call rotations. We’re focused on constantly raising the bar on best practices to minimise cybersecurity risks.</p>



                        <p>Access Controls:</p>



                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; SmartCore takes a zero-trust approach to employee access management. Employees are authenticated leveraging SSO, two-factor authentication (2FA) using a hardware-based token, and mTLS through a cryptographic certificate on SmartCore-issued machines. After connecting to the network, sensitive internal systems and those outside the scope of the employee’s standard work require additional access permissions. We have a comprehensive process for listing permitted software on employee laptops, preventing the installation of non-approved applications.<br>&nbsp; We monitor audit logs to detect abnormalities, investigate intrusions and suspicious activity, and monitor changes to sensitive files in our code base. All of SmartCore’s code undergoes multi-party review and automated testing. Code changes are recorded in an immutable, tamper-evident log. We constantly collect information about SmartCore-issued laptops to monitor for malicious processes, connections to fraudulent domains, and intruder activity.<br>&nbsp; We also use appropriate technical and organisational security measures to protect your data against accidental or intentional manipulation, partial or complete loss, destruction or unauthorised access by SmartCore employees or third parties (need-to-know access). Our security measures are continuously improved in line with technological developments.<br>We require every SmartCore employee to complete security education annually and provide secure software development training to SmartCore engineers. We also run internal phishing campaigns to test everyone at SmartCore’s ability to recognise phishing attempts and flag them for the appropriate security team.<br>&nbsp;</p>
